# ComplexNumbers-Calculator
Quick calculator program I coded using C# to help with math homework and test my C# skills.

It allows for basic addition, substraction, multiplication and division of complex numbers in polar or rectangular form.
I simply used it to check homework results. Made using Visual Studio 2012.
